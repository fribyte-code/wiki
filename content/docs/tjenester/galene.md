# Galene video conferencing

Galène is a videoconference server (an “SFU”) that is easy to deploy and that
requires very moderate server resources. It was originally designed for
lectures, conferences and student tutorials, but it is also useful for
traditional meetings. Galène has been used in production at two major
universities (Université de Paris and Sorbonne Université) for lectures,
practicals, seminars, and for staff meetings. It has been used to host a number
of conferences (including SOCS'2020, JFLA'2021 and LibrePlanet 2024).

Galène is free and open source software, subject to the MIT licence. Part of
Galène's development was supported by Nexedi.
